# pyfetch
## What is pyfetch?
pyfetch is a python alternative to the well known fetch program, neofetch! But pyfetch is not near to being mature **at all** and is not to be used as a official replacement. Just a fun little project of mine.
It's missing most of the core and convinient features that neofetch offers, let me list some of them.
### What does pyfetch not have compared to neofetch?
+ pyfetch does not have ascii logos to print in the terminal
+ pyfetch does not print images to your terminal
+ pyfetch does not offer custom themes or the creation of custom themes to print to the terminal
+ pyfetch does not support nearly any and as much operating systems as neofetch does **(Only supports MacOS, Mainstream Linux distros)**
\

I haven't even listed them all but as you can see, pyfetch is not even near to being a replacement ~~if ever~~ of neofetch and neofetch is obviously the much better option.
My coding is also very messy and most likely very error prone. Please let me know in issues if you find a problem with pyfetch. Feel free to contribute, would be glad if you could :)
## How do I download and run?
1. ```git clone https://github.com/tux777/pyfetch.git```\
   1.1 ```git checkout dev``` ***Optional step for using dev branch instead of main***
3. ```python3 fetch.py```
