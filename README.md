# pyfetch
## What is pyfetch?
pyfetch is a python alternative to the well known fetch program, neofetch! But pyfetch is not near to being mature **at all** and is not to be used as a official replacement. Just a fun little project of mine.
It's missing most of the core and convinient features that neofetch offers, let me list some of them.
#### What does pyfetch not have compared to neofetch?
* pyfetch does not print images to your terminal
* pyfetch does not offer custom themes or the creation of custom themes to print to the terminal
* pyfetch does not support nearly any and as much operating systems as neofetch does **(Only supports Windows, MacOS and some Mainstream Linux distros)**

<!-- end of the list -->

I haven't even listed them all but as you can see, pyfetch is not even near to being a replacement ~~if ever~~ of neofetch and neofetch is obviously the much better option.
My coding is also very messy and most likely very error prone. Please let me know in issues if you find a problem with pyfetch. Feel free to contribute, would be glad if you could :)
## How do I download and run?
1. ```pip install distro``` (required for linux and macos) (your linux distro might require you to install python packages with their package manager, not pip)
1.1 ```pip install wmi``` (required for windows)
2. ```git clone https://github.com/tux777/pyfetch.git```
3. ```cd pyfetch```
4. ```python3 fetch.py```
<!-- end of the list -->

*Note: pyfetch requires Python version 3.10 or newer*
